# Archive.org frontend demo

This is just a demo/experiment for a archive.org frontend. The current official one is pretty unusable but necessary as there are no alternatives.

The site is built with next.js and tailwind and the dev environment can be started with these commands:
```
yarn
yarn dev
```

The site is also deployed to Vercel as I have not used it before and wanted to try it out (though currently it is only for the ease of hosting). Maybe in the future move this to google cloud or something.

## Things that I want to implement someday
* A specific item view. Currently it is only a frontend to the search.
* Maybe investigate/do some caching/server processing to make the facet loading faster for instance.
